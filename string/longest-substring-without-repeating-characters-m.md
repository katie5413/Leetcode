# Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest**

**substring**

without repeating characters.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

```

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

```jsx
var lengthOfLongestSubstring = function (s) {
    let set = new Set();
    let left = 0;
    let maxSize = 0;

    if (s.length === 0) return 0;
    if (s.length === 1) return 1;

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {

        while (set.has(s[i])) {
            set.delete(s[left])
            left++;
        }
        set.add(s[i]);
        maxSize = Math.max(maxSize, i - left + 1)
    }
    return maxSize;
}
```

**Window Sliding Technique** is a computational technique which aims to reduce the use of nested loop and replace it with a single loop, thereby reducing the time complexity.

The Sliding window technique can reduce the time complexity to **O(n).**
